        <h1>About This Game</h1>
        <hr>

       <p>Counter-Strike 2 is a 2023 multiplayer tactical first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve.
         It is the fifth main installment of the Counter-Strike series. Developed as an updated version of the previous
          main entry, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (2012), it was announced on March 22, 2023 and was released on 
          September 27, 2023, replacing Global Offensive on Steam.</p>

        <p>
            Like its predecessor, the game pits two teams, the Counter-Terrorists and the Terrorists, against each other in various
             objective-based game modes. Counter-Strike 2 features major technical improvements over Global Offensive, including a
              move from the Source game engine to Source 2, improved graphics and new server architecture. In addition, many maps
               from Global Offensive were updated to use the features of Source 2, with some maps receiving complete overhauls.
        </p>

        <p>Upon release, Counter-Strike 2 received generally favorable reviews from critics. In contrast, player reception was mixed;
             criticism was directed at the delisting of Global Offensive from Steam, degraded game performance, and the removal of several 
             features that had been present in Global Offensive. As a result, Counter-Strike 2 received thousands of negative user reviews on Steam,
              leading to it becoming one of the lowest-rated Valve titles on the platform.</p>

                         0 anticheat. desync unreal. another game that wasnt finished. another money grab and another let
                          down. bring back CS2 mechanics and get rid of this total bull that we have to try and adjust too.</p>

                    <p>No wonder CS is 20+ years old. This game is so addictive. I was never really into gaming but this game changed my opinion. 
                        This is one of the most accurate FPS games ever made with 128 tick servers. This game requires passion, dedication, 
                        hardwork, skill & a lot of practice because every pixel counts when you trigger you gun. Rumours say CS:GO is going 
                        to shift on Source 2 Engine within 2 weeks, really excited for it.
