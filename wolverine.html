        <h1> so far that is known</h1>
        <hr>

   <p>Marvel's Wolverine is the next superheroic action game from Insomniac Games. Known for the Marvel's Spider-Man series, 
    including this year's well-received Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Insomniac has a great track record with this particular genre.
     As such, we can't wait to see how the studio tackles the darker side of Marvel. Going from the more family-friendly Spider-Man
      to the gritty violence of Wolverine makes for an ambitious leap. However, at this stage, we still don't know all that much about
       how Insomniac plans to make this particular move. That said, the studio has some of the best superhero games of recent years under
     its belt which also stand as some of the best PS5 exclusives, too. This suggests that Marvel's Wolverine will be in safe hands, even if
      it does represent a tonal shift for Insomniac.</p>

     <p>
        Marvel's Wolverine does not currently have a release date on PS5. Given that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 only released a couple of months ago, 
        we wouldn't expect to hear details about a potential Wolverine release date until late 2024 at the very earliest.Marvel's Wolverine is set 
        to be a PS5 console exclusive, much like Marvel's Spider-Man 2, so it won't be available to Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S. This isn't a 
        surprise, given how Sony acquired Insomniac Games back in 2019. We also know that it's skipping last-gen consoles, so PS4 owners are also 
        out of luck too. However, there's still a good chance it'll eventually arrive on PC, since Marvel's Spider-Man and Marvel's Spider-Man:
         Miles Morales both released on the platform, albeit well after their initial launches on Sony's home consoles.
