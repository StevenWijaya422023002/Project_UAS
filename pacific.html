        <p>Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion.

            Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. 
            
            Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. 
            
            Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.</p>

            <P>DRIVE TO SURVIVE <br>
                It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires
                 to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but
                  the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation
                   permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever
                    you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the 
                    shadows.</P>

            <p>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE <br>
                The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t 
                be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult..
                . or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed
                 with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on 
                 the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long.
                  Don’t let that be you.</p>

            <p>REPEAT <br>
                Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful
                 stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time 
                 you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is
                  ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste 
                  time — it’s going to be a long haul.</p>
