        <h1>About This Game</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>Roblox is an app that allows users to play a wide variety of games, create games, and chat with others online.
            It combines gaming, social media, and social commerce. Billing itself as the “ultimate virtual universe,”
             Roblox experiences are places where users can socialize, 
             build their own spaces, and even earn and spend virtual money.</p>

             <p>Roblox officially launched in September of 2006. It may come as a surprise to many that Roblox is older than Snapchat, 
                Discord, and even Instagram! That's 
                because the platform took much longer to gain steam.</p>
          <p>While Roblox co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel officially debuted the platform over 15 years ago,
             it didnt start to gain traction until about a decade in.
              And it really exploded in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, </p>

                    <p>Its a great app! I've been playing this since 2014 and I kinda miss guests but back to the point,
                         It may seem like a normal /app but it has thousands of games! Having each genre like horror, 
                         fantasy, story, adventure,and you can even play it on VR! You can costumize your avatar by 
                         buying stuff of getting free ugc/items! Over all there's more stuff I wanna say but it would be 
                         to long so over all, 10 OUT OF 10!!!!</p>

                    <p>The app is good, but sometimes the moderation and the updates are kind of bad (for ex: the moderators
                         let people create copyrighted musics nor avatar items, and adding voice chat into the game which could
                          be dangerous for some younger childrens). Not all of the moderation and the updates though, there is
                           a good side of this app like the anti-cheat feature, the "make your own event" feature, and the
                            "friends list" feature where you can join your friend's game, etc. So I think 4 stars is fitting</p>

                    <p>I gotten used to the previous problems now, but it's not much of a deal when you ignore it, it's kinda good.
                         But the next problem that I see is a bug, an avatar bug, when I use an outfit or any outfit saved in my catalog,
                          it dissapears when I use it in game, except the accesories. I tried re equipping them, but the bug is still not
                           fixed. If you can somehow be able to fix it, please fix it if you can. Thank you for your patience.</p>
