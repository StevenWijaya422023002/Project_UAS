        <p>HELLDIVERS™ 2 is a 3rd person squad-based shooter that sees the elite forces of the Helldivers battling
             to win an intergalactic struggle to rid the galaxy of the rising alien threats. From a 3rd person perspective
            , players use a variety of weapons (pistols, machine guns, flamethrowers) and stratagems (turrets, airstrikes, 
            etc.) to shoot and kill the alien threats. Players can also aim down the sights for a more accurate 1st person 
            camera view. Combat is accompanied by frequent sprays of blood and dismemberment as players exterminate the alien 
            forces or players and squad mates are hit by environmental explosions or friendly fire. Enemy encampments and
             battlefield environments depict bloodstains and dismembered corpses.
            
            </p>
        <p>The story of Helldivers 2 takes place in a galaxy where alien invaders are starting to slip through the cracks and
             put your planet under threat. Hoards of unknown creatures are starting to shatter the peace and wreak havoc on the
              inhabitants of your planet, and the world as you know it is starting to descend into chaos. As a Helldiver, it’s
               your responsibility to combat these alien forces and protect your home planet and restore peace. In doing so, 
               you’ll need to engage in high-stakes combat with an onslaught of alien lifeforms alongside your comrades. With
                a powerful arsenal at your disposal, Helldivers 2 offers the opportunity to customize your weaponry to your 
                playstyle, so you’re free to play around and find a style that suits you so you can confidently take part in
                 the Galactic War. </p>

        <p>Helldivers are the first line of defense, so the fate of civilization rests on your shoulders. You will need to utilize
         your environments and your weaponry within the game to dispose of the aliens coming to cause chaos on your planet in waves
          alongside your companions in what could become one of the best co-op games, but that doesn’t mean the challenge won’t put
           you and your comrade's skills to the ultimate test of survival.</p>
