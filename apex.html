        <h1>About This Game</h1>
        <hr>

       <p>Apex Legends is a first-person, online multiplayer game published by Electronic Arts and developed by
         Respawn Entertainment. Set on a distant planet in the aftermath of a galactic war, players take on the
          role of a characters fighting in huge gladiatorial games for the entertainment of unseen settlers. Players
           engage in team battles across a variety of locations while searching for supplies and weapons, including
            machine guns, rifles, and explosives. The map area decreases over time, forcing teams closer and closer
             to each other, until only one team remains.</p>

        <p>
            Players in the core game form teams of three, made up of pre-designed characters, A.K.A Legends.
             Legends each have their own personalities, abilities, skills, and boosts – making them feel like 
             fully fleshed out characters. For example, Octane is a young daredevil who got into an accident 
             and now has bionic legs. As a result, he moves and heals quickly. However, if the Octane moves 
             too far from supporting teammates these advantages are offset. All of the Legends have unique
              hooks that change the gameplay and allow a team to work strategically. 

              Like many battle royale games, Apex Legends is played online with others. Players can either team 
              up with friends to battle it out or sign on individually and get grouped with random teammates.
               Unlike similar team-based games, Apex Legends does not require direct person-to-person communication 
               via voice chat to make a team effective, although it always remains an option. Instead, players can
                use the “Ping system,” an entirely unique mode of communication.

                    <p>This game used to awsome but the match making is now horrible and its being completely ignored by 
                        the devs and leadership. Im a casual player who likes to play to unwind but instead of being able 
                        to relax, it seems like every other game is just filled with the most hardcore players in the game.
                         The ranked system is completely useless because now they have a hidden ranked system that puts you 
                         in games the ai thinks you belong in. So say you do really good one game it boosts you way up in ranks
                          and in the next game it puts you against ppl in a completely different league than you. Iv played since
                           launch and i enjoy the variety the game has to offer but whoever is calling the shots for it now are
                            missing every one of them.</p>

                    <p>This has to be the best battle royale game made The only thing I dislike is the patches they really
                         do nothing I do like the recent events I hope they keep doing this More like other br I give
                          Apex Legends a 7.5/10</p>

                    <p>Best battle royale game. Better than Fortnite and PUBG. Maps are so good. Apex Legends have a very good Story. 
                        I love to play apex Legends. Thank you Respawn Entertainment.</p>
