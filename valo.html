        <h1>About This Game</h1>
        <hr>

       <p>Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Windows.
        Teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020,
         followed by a release on June 2, 2020. The development of the game started in 2014. Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series,
          borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving.</p>

        <p>Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future.Players play as one of a set of Agents,
             characters based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either
              the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges,
               as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each
                round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased
                 using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible
                  for, and any objectives completed.</p>

                    <p>It is very strategic based, two teams of five and the objective of the game is to plant the spike.
                         It is one of those Counter Strike type of games but playing a group of preset characters with their
                          unique abilities, feels like a real tactical shooter, There are competitive modes as well which are 
                          really fun climbing the ranks.</p>

                    <p>Slowpaced fps gameplay compared to other title and it is free to play, which is a bonus. Apart from that, weapon design and graphics are really really bad. Tbh it looks like a mobile game being transitioned to pc.

                        On top of that it has the most toxic community of any online game, according to surveys.
                        
                        It should be mentioned that most fps games with a ranking system has extremely toxic communities overall and since the consequences of vitriolic behavior are as good as non-existent it will gradually alienate big parts of the player base.
                        
                        If you want to relax and have a good time, then this game is not something for you.

                    <h3>Chris Carter</h3>
                    <p>As a hardcore shooter fan since the '90s, Valorant feels very well designed, and provides me with a rush I
                         haven't gotten out of so many other big genre games in the past five years. But Valorant feels like it was
                          meticulously designed in a laboratory to fault.
                         It's fitting given that Riot has over a decade of data and esports experience, 
                         but the sterile feel of it does impact my decision to play it more regularly.</p>
