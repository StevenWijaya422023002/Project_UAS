        <h1>About This Game</h1>
        <hr>

       <p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (CoD:MW) is a first-person shooter game that was released in 2007, and it has been 
        played by many people since then. It was developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. The game has a 
        lot of different modes that can be played in single player or multiplayer mode. In multiplayer mode, there are 
        many different game types that can be played such as team deathmatch, capture the flag, domination or search and 
        destroy. The single player mode has different missions that need to be completed before you can progress to the 
        next mission.</p>

        <p>
            The best thing about this game is its graphics. They are very realistic and give you an amazing feeling 
            when playing the game. The sound effects are also very good and make it feel like you are actually there
             in real life fighting against other players on your team or against other enemy teams as well as fighting 
             against AI bots in story mode missions too!

                    <p>UI is so bad i have to not recommend this game so others may avoid it. cant just play mw2 gotta 
                        launch cod hq then you gotta select mw2 and you gotta restart. you get more restarts if there 
                        is any kind of update. Also they completely got rid of ranked. they could have at least put in
                         a code to have it reset like once a month or something.</p>

                    <p>The game itself is okay, but activison almost wants you not to play it. Launching the game is such
                         a terrible mechanic - you launch the game, but it launches mw3 instead. Ok so you'll need to just
                          need to select mw2 from a menu right? Nope, you scroll down, then select mw2, which exits the game
                           to launch mw2. And god forbid you have an update, you download the updates, which are 20gb in size
                           , then launch to play, but nope the update requires the game to restart. Okay finally! Now you can
                            play. Nope, the update was for mw3 which i dont even own, and now i have to restart mw2 and go
                             through the entire process again.

                        The campaign had a decent enough story, and they even made laswell a lesbian to appease the liberals.
                         SBMM is terrible, and i dont get why it is cranked so high even though ranked literally exists. They
                          want you to keep playing, but do a bad job of making you interested. Double xp tokens should count 
                          only for in-match time, not all the time. Leveling up guns is meh and could be better. And can we 
                          please have stats in game instead of useless bars?

                    <p>Best casual arcade-shooter I've played in a long time!
                        Great graphics, state of the art gunplay, amazing soundtrack.
                        I especially enjoyed the refreshed gunsmith with weapon tuning and recivers!
                        
                        Get this only if you're interested in playing the campaign, co-op or raid, since theres no longer any battlepass.
                        And if you bus Modern Warfare III you can get 99Â°of the stuff you could get in this game.</p>
