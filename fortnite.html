        <h1>About This Game</h1>
        <hr>

        <p> Fortnite is an online video game and game platform developed by Epic Games and released in 2017.
             It is available in six distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay
              and game engine: Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players
               fight to be the last person standing; Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative hybrid tower
                defense-shooter and survival game in which up to four players fight off zombie-like creatures and
                 defend objects with traps and fortifications they can build; and Fortnite Creative, in which players
                  are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas, Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing and
                   Fortnite Festival. In addition to the battle royale mode, Fortnite also has other game modes,
                    such as "Save the World," which focuses more on cooperative play, and "Creative," which allows players
                     to create their own content.</p>

        <p>
            Art Style and Features:

            The game has a unique art style with vibrant animated graphics and quirky characters.
            Players can personalize their characters with various costumes and accessories, often sold in the in-game store using virtual currency.
        </p>

        <p>
            Partnerships and Special Events:

            Fortnite often collaborates with well-known brands to bring characters and elements from popular culture into the game. For example, collaborations with characters from Marvel, DC, Star Wars, and more.
            Special events and tournaments are held periodically to engage players in larger gaming experiences.

                    <p>Fortnite is a game that gets endless praise and endless hate. It deserves neither. 
                        Fortnite is a game where you can relax and have fun with friends. No narrative, 
                        no real goals other than to rank up and win games. With a lackluster "save the world" 
                        game mode which acts as a zombie survival shooter, Battle Royale has cemented itself as
                         a fun and quick paced game that honest fun.</p>

                    <h3>CheddarKing</h3>
                    <p>Fortnite is an amazing game with lots of very talented people working for it. They somehow manage
                         to keep the game fresh and original after all these years, and it's amazing how far this game
                          has come since it was first released. I really don't understand why this game doesn't have a
                           way higher rating, because it absolutely deserves it. The one thing i guess people could 
                           complain about is the building, which is really hard to get the hang of. I never got the hang
                            of building. But, ever since they added in no build, the game is so much better. This game is
                             now my go-to game for fun on a friday night with friends.</p>

                    <p>Season 1,2,3,4 and maybe 5 were playable. Other is just trash. Bad storyline, 
                        stupid map changes and tryhard players destroyed the fun i had playing it. Just end it.</p>
