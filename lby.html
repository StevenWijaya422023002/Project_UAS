     <p>Be in total control of the humans that you create, the towns that you build, the stories that you tell.
         And oh yes - mods! As an Early Access game, we look forward to working directly with you, our players,
          to determine the ideas and content that will drive the priorities in our game development and bring Life 
          by You to full-launch. We know life is always better with a heavy sprinkle of your imagination, so we’re 
          empowering you with a wide variety of Creator Tools so you can design your lives the way you see fit - or 
          break the rules of life itself. Designed to be one of the most moddable and open life-simulation games, we 
          look forward to the humans, stories, and creations that you’ll make with Life by You.</p>

    <p>
        Play in an open world <br>
        Live life with no loading screens. Strike up real-language conversations. Drive or bike to the countryside. 
        Discover and complete quests to unlock new experiences.

        Expand your creativity <br>

    </p>

    <p>
        Tell stories through conversations <br>
        Every real-language conversation is generated based on your human’s unique situation. You can even craft your own conversations in-game.
