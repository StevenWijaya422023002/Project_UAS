        <h1>About This Game</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios and originally released in 2009. The game was created by
             Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, 
             it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down
              and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has become the best-selling video game in history,
               with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2023. It has been ported 
               to several platforms.</p>
        <p>In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, pixelated procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with 
            virtually infinite terrain. Players can discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build
             structures, earthworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, 
             as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival
              mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health), creative mode 
              (in which players have unlimited resources and the ability to fly), spectator mode (in which players can 
              fly, go through blocks, and enter the bodies of other players and entities), adventure mode (in which 
              players have to survive without being able to build and place blocks) and hardcore mode (in which the 
              difficulty is set to Hard and dying causes the player to lose their ability to play on that world).</p>

                    <p>It's a good foundation, but it's not a good game on its own. You will grow tired and bored of 
                        this one fairly quickly. However, if you play on PC, you can download modpacks like Tekkit 
                        and Feed The Beast which will give you LOTS more to do. Or, if you want, you can download 
                        your own mods and pick and choose. You'll definitely want to do that eventually since the 
                        vanilla base game becomes repetitive after awhile</p>

                    <p>Minecraft is probably the most fun, yet surprisingly educational, game I have ever played.

                        The possibilities are infinite - you can build absolutely anything! You can build a mansion, or a city, anything that your imagination can think of! That is the thing I like about this game. It teaches kids and adults alike very important life skills if you are ever alone and lost on a island.
                        
                        Before I played this game, I knew next to nothing about gold, diamond, etc., nothing about other bricks like obsidian, marble, and also things like brewing, Redstone, the list goes on and on. This game has taught me so many things, while playing and having fun.
                        
                        Another awesome aspect, multi player. It is so fun playing with other people, helping people build, and working on awesome, big projects.
                        
                        But yeah, if I will get lost on a island one day, Minecraft taught me how to survive.

                    <p>This is one of the best games ever in the whole world, and one of the only games that's going to
                         live beyond any other game in the whole world, it keeps updating its content and it keeps bringing new 
                         stuff into the game, and I remember the first time I played it in 2012, it is one of the best game in 
                         my heart and many people's hearts as well, I don't believe we will ever have a game like this ever, 
                         there are a lot of stuff you can do with it like mods and play in different servers with different 
                         mini games the fun is endless in Minecraft.</p>
