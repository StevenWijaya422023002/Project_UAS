       <p>Psychological Horror meets Southern Gothic in this reimagination of the classic survival horror game, Alone in the Dark
        This love letter to the ground-breaking original lets you experience a haunting story through the eyes of one of two protagonists.
         Play as either Edward Carnby or Emily Hartwood and explore your environments, fight monsters, solve puzzles and uncover the uneasy truth
         of Derceto Manor The player fights against monsters with guns and melee weapons. No excessive gore or dismemberment, but violence against non-human enemies is displayed.
         Some of the game's themes imply self-harm, such as suicide and depression, but are not shown explicitly.A remake of the original game was in active development by Eden Games
          after the release of Alone in the Dark: Inferno.<br> <br> But following the liquidation of the studio by Atari in 2013, the game was cancelled.Three years after the poor reception of
           Alone in the Dark: Illumination, then-owner Atari SA sold the Alone in the Dark franchise to THQ Nordic in September 2018. Pieces Interactive, which was most known for making Magicka 2,
            commenced the game's development in 2019. It will feature an original plot that incorporates characters from the first three Alone in the Dark games. The team was inspired by the success
             of Resident Evil 2 in 2019, and Resident Evil 3 in 2020. The game was written by Mikael Hedberg, who had previously worked at Frictional Games on Soma and Amnesia: The Dark Descent.
              Artist Guy Davis, best known for his work with Guillermo del Toro and his own comic series The Marquis, was recruited to design the monsters featured in the game. Series creator Frédérick
               Raynal gave his blessings to the reimagining saying that Pieces Interactive did a great job preserving the "core feeling" from the original game.
