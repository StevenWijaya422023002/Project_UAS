        <h1>About This Game</h1>
        <hr>

       <p>Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first released 
        for PlayStation 4 and Windows in July 2015, with ports for Xbox One and Nintendo Switch being released later on.
         In June 2016, 505 Games began distributing a physical retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with Warner
          Bros. Interactive Entertainment taking over those duties by the end of 2017. Versions for macOS and Linux were
           also released in 2016, but support for their online services were dropped in 2020. The game went free-to-play
            in September 2020 when Epic Games took ownership.</p>

        <p>
            Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has up to eight players assigned to each 
            of the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score points 
            over the course of a match. The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes that can be played both 
            locally and online, including cross-platform play between all versions. Later updates for the game enabled
             the ability to modify core rules and added new game modes, including ones based on ice hockey and basketball.

                    <p>I enjoyed the game and found really good to play. It have interesting mechanics and its easy to 
                        learn but hard to master. I found it very good anyway alone or with more players. And its a 
                        definitely a game that will require some skills from the player.</p>
