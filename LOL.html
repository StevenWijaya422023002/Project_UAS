        <h1>About This Game</h1>
        <hr>

       <p> is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre video game developed by Riot Games. 
        It was designed to operate on the Microsoft Windows operating system. The game was first announced on October 7, 
        2008 and released a year later on October 27, 2009. The game was in beta from April 10, 2009 to October 26th, 2009.
        

        Two main protagonists for the popular Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne mod, Defense of the Ancients: Allstars (commonly abbreviated as DotA), Steve 'Guinsoo'
         Feak and Steve 'Pendragon' Mescon are involved with Riot Games in the process of making of League of Legends. Guinsoo
          created DotA: Allstars from the original DotA, created by Eul, by adding his own mix of content, including over 40 heroes,
           numerous items, and various gameplay changes. Guinsoo then passed DotA: Allstars on to its current developer, Icefrog. Pendragon,
            who is the Director of Community Relations for Riot Games, helped create the DotA: Allstars website along with its forums, and is still
             currently working on DotA: Allstars alongside League of Legends. The core game is free to play, and new users can register an account here.</p>
            

        <p>Players are formed into two even teams primarily comprised of five members. Each team starts at opposing sides of a map, near what is called a
             "Nexus". To win a match, a team must destroy the opposing team's Nexus. To do so, each team must work through a series of towers called 'turrets'
              that are placed along three paths to each base (commonly referred to as 'lanes') Along the way, each player gains power by completing game objectives,
               earning them experience points and gold that are used to increase the player's level and to purchase powerful items, potentially giving players an advantage 
               over their opponents. Examples of these objectives include killing the opposing team's turrets, players, and 'minions' (small NPCs that constantly spawn and attack
                the other team).</p>

                        As said above, the game isn't on the current technical state, but the Tower - Defense concept is still fun after
                         5 years and to play Garen on bot lane as Support is always funny. But if you start to play LoL in 2014 you will
                          have problems with smurfs and flamers etc. But as you can see on the viewer amount on twitch.TV LoL is know one
                           of the most famous games in the world with around 15 million active player and around 50000 viewers on twitch
                            per event.</p>

                    <p>Although game itself was really good, community is doing everything to destroy it, also riot games besides few good
                         updates (Like mythic items and champions reworks) doesnt do anything good for the game in 2021 we got literally one
                          of the worst chams to play against (viego, gwen, akshan) and awful event ruination that pretty much ruined the lore.
                           Since 2017 riot haven't made a single monster champ which is also pretty underwelming.

                    <p>Most toxic community in the whole gaming world. This game is only good if you want to get diabetes from rage induced stress.
                         It shouldnt be alowed to exist. It is not fun ! People only play it because they are a low life losers that are only good at
                          this one thing. Even they hate the game. I was playing for years and when i stoped my life got better!</p>
