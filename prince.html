        <p>The Lost Crown is a 2.5D side-scrolling action-adventure platform video game. The game's protagonist, 
            Sargon, can jump, slide, and air dash to quickly travel between platforms. He can also use his pair
             of blades to defeat enemies. A well-timed parry will help build up Sargon's Athra's Glow, which allows
              him to unleash a special ability when it is completely filled. Player will have access to several
               time-based powers for both combat and platforming purposes. Rush of the Simurgh allows Sargon to
                instantly dash forward through time, while Shadow of the Simurgh lets him place a "shadow marker", 
                which serves as a tempoarily checkpoint that players can return to instantaneously. Sargon can also 
                be equipped with talismans that alter his abilities. <br> <br>
            
                The game also includes elements commonly found in Metroidvania video games. The game world is 
                interconnected and filled with shortcuts and secret rooms, and players have to solve various puzzles
                 in order to progress. By exploring the game's world, players will find Time crystals, which can be 
                 used to purchase new upgrades for Sargon's weapons. Players may not immediately have the tools or
                  skills to overcome an obstacle, though the game allows players to take screenshots and pin them to 
                  the game's map, allowing them to easily recognize and remember any unsolved puzzles they have 
                  encountered in their journey.
                    <br> <br>
                  The game introduces a new hero named Sargon, a young member of a warrior clan named The Immortals. 
                  Sargon must travel to the cursed city of Mount Qaf to rescue the kidnapped Prince Ghassan.
