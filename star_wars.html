     <p>Star Wars: Hunters is an upcoming free-to-play player-vs-player competitive arena combat game being developed by
         Zynga for Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android, set to be released in 2024. The game takes place after the fall
          of the Galactic Empire featuring a new cast of characters including bounty hunters, rebellion heroes and 
          imperial stormtroopers. <br> <br>
        
          On August 18, 2018, Zynga and Disney brokered a deal for a Star Wars game on mobile to be developed by Zynga 
          and its subsidiary NaturalMotion. Star Wars: Hunters was formally announced during the Nintendo Direct 
          presentation on February 17, 2021 with a teaser trailer with initial plans to release the game by the end of 
          2021. The first gameplay footage was shown off in September 2021 after during an Apple Event while 
          showcasing the iPad Mini. A cinematic trailer was released shortly after depicting some of the characters 
          featured in the game, including the Sith warrior, Rieve and Mandalorian, Aran Tal.In late 2021, Star Wars: 
          Hunters was soft-launched on Android devices in India, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. Despite this,
           on July 18, 2022, Zynga announced that the official release of Star Wars: Hunters would be delayed until
            2023.On November 8, 2023, Zynga's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, announced during its quarterly
             earnings call that Star Wars: Hunters had been once again delayed and is scheduled to release in 2024.
